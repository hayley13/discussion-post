        <h2>Radiolab</h2>
       
        <h4>The Structure of the Podcast</h4>
           
            <p>The structure of this podcast is centered around the topic of colors.  As the webpage says, this podcast is season 10, episode 13 of Radiolab, entitiled "Colors."  Concerning the topic of colors, the conversation of the podcast jumps around from sub-topic to sub-topic, which includes: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Sir Isaac Newton and his prisms</li>
                <li>Manta shrimps that have sixteen different cones in their eyes</li>
                <li>Tetrachromatic women</li>
                <li>The pretty yellow color of tree sap</li>
                <li>The words used to describe colors in the olden days</li>
                <li>Whether a little girl can understand on her own that the ski is blue, etc.</li>
            </ul> 
              <p>These various sections of conversation about the main topic, which push the narrative forward, are mixed with sound effects and music, and are periodically interjected with acknowledgements and advertisements voiced by hosts Jad and Robert. </p>
              
        <h4>Who Is Doing Most of the Talking?</h4>
           
            <p>The Hosts Jad and Robert do most of the talking as they interview various other people on - or play recordings of various other people discussing - the topic of color.  Musicians and singers perform intermittently throughout the podcast.</p>
            
        <h4>Is It Scripted?</h4>
           
            <p>I believe that this podcast is somewhat scripted.  At least, the organization of topics covered and the questions to be asked were scripted, as well as the musical performances.  Most of the responses were not scripted.  </p>
            
        <h4>Is it Based Mostly on Interviews?</h4>
           
            <p>The podcast is based on an interview, yes, or various interviews conducted throughout the recording.  It is also based on conversations centered around recordings - really, the whole podcast sounds more conversational than interview-y.</p>
            
        <h4>What are the Sound Effects or Music Elements Present?</h4>
           
            <p>Some of the sound effects include: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Mixtures of music and vocals</li>
                <li>Strange oises and period music</li>
                <li>Background noise to accompany certain points in the narrative or support the conversation</li>
                <li>Voice recordings of people not really there</li>
                <li>Music to add effect to what is being said.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Homecoming</h2>
       
        <h4>The Structure of the Podcast</h4>
           
            <p>The structure of this podcast is centered around a fictional story, as it is an episode of the online narrative Homecoming.  The main sections of this podcast consist of: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>An Introduction by Eli Horowitz</li>
                <li>The Main Story Played out by the Actors as Characters</li>
                <li>Then the credits and a mini interview between Alex Blumberg and Eli Horowitz.</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>Who Is Doing Most of the Talking?</h4>
           
            <p>As the majority of this podcast consists of the fictional story that is Homecoming, the various actors playing characters within the story do most of the talking.  Eli Horowitz conducts introductions at the very beginning for a few minutes, and he is later interviewed by Alex Blumberg for a few minutes at the very end.</p>
            
        <h4>Is It Scripted?</h4>
           
            <p>Yes, the majority of this podcast is scripted.  The actor's contributions are definitely scripted, as is, I would say, the introduction by Eli Horowitz at the beginning.  I would also say that Alex's interview questions at the end were scripted, while Eli's responses were not. </p>
            
        <h4>Is it Based Mostly on Interviews?</h4>
           
            <p>This podcast is not mostly based on interviews.  It is mostly based on the playing out of a fictional story, though there is a short interview at the end. </p>
            
        <h4>What are the Sound Effects or Music Elements Present?</h4>
           
            <p>There are various sound effects and music elements present: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>A mixture of windy music and a slow piano</li>
                <li>Sound that seems to build up, and then all of a sudden stops</li>
                <li>Sound effects that match the actions taking place, the the things described, or the settings of the scenes, such as doors opening, the watery hum of an aquarium, and the bustling background noises of an airport and a restaurant, etc.</li>
            </ul>
