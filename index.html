        <h1>Serial</h1>
       
        <h4>The Structure of the Podcast</h4>
           
            <p>The structure of this podcast is centered around the unfolding reportage of Hae Min Lee's murder and the trial of accused Adnan Syed.  As the webpage says, this podcast is season 1, episode 1 of Serial, entitiled "The Alibi."  The structure of this podcast is made of a mixture of: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Narration</li>
                <li>Interviews</li>
                <li>Recorded phone calls</li>
            </ul> 
              
        <h4>Who Is Doing Most of the Talking?</h4>
           
            <p>The host Sarah Koenig does most of the talking as she narrates the majority of this podcast and even interviews various people mentioned in her narration.  </p>
            
        <h4>Is It Scripted?</h4>
           
            <p>The real story upon which this podcast is based was not scripted, the interview responses were not scripted, and the conversations were not scripted.  The narration, however, was mostly likely scripted and formulated around the intermixing phone calls, interviews, and conversations.</p>
            
        <h4>Is It Based Mostly on Interviews?</h4>
           
            <p>This podcast is mostly based on narration, though there are sporadic interviews, conversations, and phone calls that take place throughout.</p>
            
        <h4>What are the Sound Effects or Music Elements Present?</h4>
           
            <p>Some of the music and sound effects include: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Background music to set the mood of what is being said, or emphasize what is being said</li>
                <li>The background noises of the real life settings wherein some interviews took place</li>
                <li>Narration that occassionally describes a conversation, which is made louder and played so the listener can hear, and then drowned out again by the narration</li>
                <li>Background music that serves as a break from the narration, or a pause in intervals</li>
            </ul>

    <h1>S-Town</h1>
       
        <h4>The Structure of the Podcast</h4>
           
            <p>The structure of this podcast is centered around the story of S-Town, which consists mainly of host Brian Reed's conversations and interactions with John B. McLemore, which center around an alleged murder.  The structure of this podcast is also made of a mixture of:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Narration</li>
                <li>Interviews</li>
                <li>Recorded phone calls</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h4>Who Is Doing Most of the Talking?</h4>
           
            <p>I would say that host Brian Reed does most of the talking, since he provides the narration that makes up a rather large portion of the podcast.  However, I believe it may be John B. McLemore that does most of the talking, as Brian lets play long recordings of John talking on the phone, and John spends much of this podcast telling Brian about the alleged murder.</p>
            
        <h4>Is It Scripted?</h4>
           
            <p>Again, as with the last podcast: the real story upon which this podcast is based was not scripted, the interview responses were not scripted, and the conversations were not scripted.  The narration, however, was mostly likely scripted and formulated around the intermixing phone calls, interviews, and conversations.  Although, considering how uncertain it is whether John is telling the truth or not, his stories about the murder to Brian might just be scripted, on his part.</p>
            
        <h4>Is it Based Mostly on Interviews?</h4>
           
            <p>Also, again, as with the last podcast: this podcast is mostly based on narration, though there are sporadic interviews, conversations, and phone calls that take place throughout. </p>
            
        <h4>What are the Sound Effects or Music Elements Present?</h4>
           
            <p>This podcast has music elements and sound effects similar to that of the last podcast: <br />
            <ul>
                 <li>Background music to set the mood of what is being said, or emphasize what is being said</li>
                <li>The background noises of the real life settings wherein some interviews took place</li>
                <li>Narration that occassionally describes a conversation, which is made louder and played so the listener can hear, and then drowned out again by the narration</li>
                <li>Background music that serves as a break from the narration, or a pause in intervals</li>
            </ul>
